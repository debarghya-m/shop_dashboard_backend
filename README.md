# Shop Management Web Application (Backend)

This repository contains the backend portion of a comprehensive web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application empowers shop owners with efficient tools for managing customer information, tracking recent transactions, monitoring outstanding dues, and recording purchases.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Implements a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for managing customer information, transactions, dues, and purchases.
- **Authentication:** Provides secure authentication mechanisms for shop owners to access the application's features.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Utilizes MongoDB as the database to store customer information, transaction data, and purchase records.
- **Data Validation:** Implements validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data stored in the database.
- **Error Handling:** Incorporates robust error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to clients.
- **Security:** Implements security best practices to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to resources.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js used for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data related to customers, transactions, dues, and purchases.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for secure authentication.
- **bcrypt.js:** A library for hashing and salting passwords to enhance security.
- **Express Validator:** A middleware for Express.js used for data validation and sanitization.
- **Helmet:** A middleware for Express.js used for securing HTTP headers and enhancing application security.

## Getting Started

To run the backend portion of the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure environment variables (e.g., database connection URI, JWT secret).
5. Start the server using `npm start`.
6. The server will start running on the specified port, and you can now make API requests to interact with the application.
